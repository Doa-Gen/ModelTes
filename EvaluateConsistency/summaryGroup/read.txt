Early on a sunny Saturday, my parents, little brother Tom, and I loaded the car for a trip to Silver Sands Beach, a 45-minute drive from our neighborhood. Mom packed a cooler with cold drinks, potato salad, and cut watermelon, while Dad checked the beach umbrella and folding chairs. Tom, bouncing in the backseat, kept asking if we’d spot dolphins—he’d seen a documentary about them the night before.
When we arrived, the parking lot was already busy, but we found a spot near the boardwalk. The moment we stepped onto the sand, Tom sprinted toward the water, his sandals flopping. Dad and I set up the umbrella, and Mom spread out a checkered blanket. The ocean sparkled under the sun, waves rolling in with a soft crash, and seagulls circled overhead, crying like they were joining our excitement.
After lunch, we played a game of frisbee—Tom kept chasing it into the water, getting soaked but laughing louder each time. Later, Dad taught me to skip stones; mine sank immediately, but his skipped three times before disappearing. Tom built a lopsided sandcastle with a moat, then insisted Mom bury his legs in sand “so the tide won’t take me away.”
By late afternoon, clouds started drifting in, so we packed up. On the way to the car, we stopped at a snack shack—Tom got a blue snow cone that stained his lips, and I chose a chocolate ice cream cone that melted down my hand. Dad joked that next time, we’d bring extra napkins.
Driving home, Tom fell asleep in the back, clutching a seashell he’d found. Mom sighed, “Perfect day, isn’t it?” Dad nodded, glancing at the sunset painting the sky pink. I thought about the way the sand felt between my toes and the sound of waves—simple things, but ones that made my heart feel full.
